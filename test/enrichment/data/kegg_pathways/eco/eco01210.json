{"ENTRY": "eco01210                    Pathway", "NAME": "2-Oxocarboxylic acid metabolism", "DESCRIPTION": "2-Oxocarboxylic acids, also called 2-oxo acids and alpha-keto acids, are the most elementary set of metabolites that includes pyruvate (2-oxopropanoate), 2-oxobutanoate, oxaloacetate (2-oxosuccinate) and 2-oxoglutarate. This diagram illustrates the architecture of chain extension and modification reaction modules for 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module RM001 is a tricarboxylic pathway where acetyl-CoA derived carbon is used to extend the chain length by one. The chain modification modules RM002 (including RM032) and RM033, together with a reductive amination step (RC00006 or RC00036), generate basic and branched-chain amino acids, respectively. The modification module RM030 is used in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, a class of plant secondary metabolites, for conversion to oxime followed by addition of thio-glucose moiety. Furthermore, the chain extension from 2-oxoadipate to 2-oxosuberate is followed by coenzyme B biosynthesis in methonogenic archaea.", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco01210": "2-Oxocarboxylic acid metabolism"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00010": "Citrate cycle, first carbon oxidation, oxaloacetate => 2-oxoglutarate [PATH:eco01210]", "eco_M00019": "Valine/isoleucine biosynthesis, pyruvate => valine / 2-oxobutanoate => isoleucine [PATH:eco01210]", "eco_M00028": "Ornithine biosynthesis, glutamate => ornithine [PATH:eco01210]", "eco_M00432": "Leucine biosynthesis, 2-oxoisovalerate => 2-oxoisocaproate [PATH:eco01210]"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "REL_PATHWAY": "eco00020  Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)             eco00220  Arginine biosynthesis             eco00260  Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism             eco00290  Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis             eco00300  Lysine biosynthesis             eco00680  Methane metabolism", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko01210"}
