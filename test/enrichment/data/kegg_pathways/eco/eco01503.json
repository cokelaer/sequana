{"ENTRY": "eco01503                    Pathway", "NAME": "Cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance", "DESCRIPTION": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) play an important role in host defense against microbial infection and are key components of the innate immune response. These are found among all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to humans. In addition to the natural peptides, thousands of synthetic variants have been produced. CAMPs weaken the integrity of the bacterial inner and outer membranes and subsequently kill bacterial cells. On the other hand, bacteria have developed a number of mechanisms against CAMPs. These resistance mechanisms include decreased affinity to CAMPs by substitution of anionic cell surface constituents with cationic molecules; biosynthesis and crosslinking of cell envelope components; external trapping mechanisms that bind or neutralize the CAMPs by direct secretion of proteins, or the release of CAMPs binding molecules from the host cell surface; membrane efflux pumps; and production of peptidases.", "CLASS": "Human Diseases; Drug resistance: antimicrobial", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco01503": "Cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "REFERENCE": [{"REFERENCE": "PMID:16450883", "AUTHORS": "Nizet V", "TITLE": "Antimicrobial peptide resistance mechanisms of human bacterial pathogens.", "JOURNAL": "Curr Issues Mol Biol 8:11-26 (2006)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:22339775", "AUTHORS": "Gruenheid S, Le Moual H", "TITLE": "Resistance to antimicrobial peptides in Gram-negative bacteria.", "JOURNAL": "FEMS Microbiol Lett 330:81-9 (2012)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:25419466", "AUTHORS": "Nawrocki KL, Crispell EK, McBride SM", "TITLE": "Antimicrobial Peptide Resistance Mechanisms of Gram-Positive Bacteria.", "JOURNAL": "Antibiotics (Basel) 3:461-492 (2014)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:22799636", "AUTHORS": "Anaya-Lopez JL, Lopez-Meza JE, Ochoa-Zarzosa A", "TITLE": "Bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.", "JOURNAL": "Crit Rev Microbiol 39:180-95 (2013)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:23748343", "AUTHORS": "Needham BD, Trent MS", "TITLE": "Fortifying the barrier: the impact of lipid A remodelling on bacterial pathogenesis.", "JOURNAL": "Nat Rev Microbiol 11:467-81 (2013)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:17928292", "AUTHORS": "Yan A, Guan Z, Raetz CR", "TITLE": "An undecaprenyl phosphate-aminoarabinose flippase required for polymyxin resistance in Escherichia coli.", "JOURNAL": "J Biol Chem 282:36077-89 (2007)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:15695810", "AUTHORS": "Breazeale SD, Ribeiro AA, McClerren AL, Raetz CR.", "TITLE": "A formyltransferase required for polymyxin resistance in Escherichia coli and the modification of lipid A with 4-Amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose.
