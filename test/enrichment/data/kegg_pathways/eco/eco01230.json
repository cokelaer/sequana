{"ENTRY": "eco01230                    Pathway", "NAME": "Biosynthesis of amino acids", "DESCRIPTION": "This map presents a modular architecture of the biosynthesis pathways of twenty amino acids, which may be viewed as consisting of the core part and its extensions. The core part is the KEGG module for conversion of three-carbon compounds from glyceraldehyde-3P to pyruvate [MD:M00002], together with the pathways around serine and glycine. This KEGG module is the most conserved one in the KEGG MODULE database and is found in almost all the completely sequenced genomes. The extensions are the pathways containing the reaction modules RM001, RM033, RM032, and RM002 for biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (left) and basic amino acids (bottom), and the pathways for biosynthesis of histidine and aromatic amino acids (top right). It is interesting to note that the so-called essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized in human and other organisms generally appear in these extensions. Furthermore, the bottom extension of basic amino acids appears to be most divergent containing multiple pathways for lysine biosynthesis and multiple gene sets for arginine biosynthesis.", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco01230": "Biosynthesis of amino acids"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00002": "Glycolysis, core module involving three-carbon compounds [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00005": "PRPP biosynthesis, ribose 5P => PRPP [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00007": "Pentose phosphate pathway, non-oxidative phase, fructose 6P => ribose 5P [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00010": "Citrate cycle, first carbon oxidation, oxaloacetate => 2-oxoglutarate [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00015": "Proline biosynthesis, glutamate => proline [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00016": "Lysine biosynthesis, succinyl-DAP pathway, aspartate => lysine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00017": "Methionine biosynthesis, aspartate => homoserine => methionine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00018": "Threonine biosynthesis, aspartate => homoserine => threonine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00019": "Valine/isoleucine biosynthesis, pyruvate => valine / 2-oxobutanoate => isoleucine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00020": "Serine biosynthesis, glycerate-3P => serine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00021": "Cysteine biosynthesis, serine => cysteine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00022": "Shikimate pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate + erythrose-4P => chorismate [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00023": "Tryptophan biosynthesis, chorismate => tryptophan [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00024": "Phenylalanine biosynthesis, chorismate => phenylpyruvate => phenylalanine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00025": "Tyrosine biosynthesis, chorismate => HPP => tyrosine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00026": "Histidine biosynthesis, PRPP => histidine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00028": "Ornithine biosynthesis, glutamate => ornithine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00432": "Leucine biosynthesis, 2-oxoisovalerate => 2-oxoisocaproate [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00570": "Isoleucine biosynthesis, threonine => 2-oxobutanoate => isoleucine [PATH:eco01230]", "eco_M00844": "Arginine biosynthesis, ornithine => arginine [PATH:eco01230]"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko01230"}
