{"ENTRY": "eco00521                    Pathway", "NAME": "Streptomycin biosynthesis", "DESCRIPTION": "Streptomycin is an aminocyclitol-aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin consists of aminocyclitol (streptidine), 6-deoxyhexose (streptose), and N-methyl-L-glucosamine moieties, which are formed by independent biosynthetic pathways. All of the moieties are derived from D-glucose. The streptidine moiety is synthesized via myo-inositol, which is then oxidized at C-1 and transaminated to give scyllo-inosamine. After phosphorylation, the compound is transamidinated by arginine. The same procedure is repeated at the C-3 position. The streptose moiety is made from D-glucose via a dTDP-glucose pathway. The exact biosynthetic route for the N-methyl-L-glucosamine moiety is unknown, though the biosynthetic gene cluster have been proposed.", "CLASS": "Metabolism; Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco00521": "Streptomycin biosynthesis"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00793": "dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis [PATH:eco00521]"}, "DBLINKS": {"GO": "0019872"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "GENE": {"b2388": "glk; glucokinase [KO:K00845] [EC:2.7.1.2]", "b0688": "pgm; phosphoglucomutase [KO:K01835] [EC:5.4.2.2]", "b2533": "suhB; inositol-phosphate phosphatase [KO:K01092] [EC:3.1.3.25]", "b3789": "rffH; dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 [KO:K00973] [EC:2.7.7.24]", "b2039": "rfbA; dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase [KO:K00973] [EC:2.7.7.24]", "b3788": "rffG; dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase 2 [KO:K01710] [EC:4.2.1.46]", "b2041": "rfbB; dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase 1 [KO:K01710] [EC:4.2.1.46]", "b2038": "rfbC; dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase [KO:K01790] [EC:5.1.3.13]", "b2040": "rfbD; dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase [KO:K00067] [EC:1.1.1.133]"}, "COMPOUND": {"C00031": "D-Glucose", "C00092": "D-Glucose 6-phosphate", "C00103": "D-Glucose 1-phosphate", "C00137": "myo-Inositol", "C00413": "Streptomycin", "C00688": "dTDP-4-dehydro-beta-L-rhamnose", "C00691": "2,4,6/3,5-Pentahydroxycyclohexanone", "C00842": "dTDP-glucose", "C01121": "Streptidine 6-phosphate", "C01138": "Streptomycin 6-phosphate", "C01214": "1-Amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol", "C01221": "Dihydrostreptomycin 6-phosphate", "C01283": "1-Amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphate", "C01294": "1-Guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphate", "C01298": "1D-1-Guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol", "C03319": "dTDP-L-rhamnose", "C03442": "dTDP-L-dihydrostreptose", "C04006": "1D-myo-Inositol 3-phosphate", "C04280": "1-Guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol", "C04673": "1D-1-Guanidino-1-deoxy-3-dehydro-scyllo-inositol", "C04767": "O-(1->4)-alpha-L-Dihydrostreptosyl-streptidine 6-phosphate", "C06592": "NDP-N-methyl-L-glucosamine", "C11351": "N1-Amidinostreptamine 6-phosphate", "C11907": "dTDP-4-oxo-6-deoxy-D-glucose"}, "REFERENCE": [{"REFERENCE": "PMID:19362651", "AUTHORS": "Wehmeier UF, Piepersberg W", "TITLE": "Enzymology of aminoglycoside biosynthesis-deduction from gene clusters.", "JOURNAL": "Methods Enzymol 459:459-91 (2009)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:17390001", "AUTHORS": "Flatt PM, Mahmud T", "TITLE": "Biosynthesis of aminocyclitol-aminoglycoside antibiotics and related compounds.", "JOURNAL": "Nat Prod Rep 24:358-92 (2007)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:1698764", "AUTHORS": "Walker JB", "TITLE": "Possible evolutionary relationships between streptomycin and bluensomycin biosynthetic pathways: detection of novel inositol kinase and O-carbamoyltransferase activities.", "JOURNAL": "J Bacteriol 172:5844-51 (1990)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:2995326", "AUTHORS": "Ohnuki T, Imanaka T, Aiba S", "TITLE": "Self-cloning in Streptomyces griseus of an str gene cluster for streptomycin biosynthesis and streptomycin resistance.", "JOURNAL": "J Bacteriol 164:85-94 (1985)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:9238101", "AUTHORS": "Ahlert J, Distler J, Mansouri K, Piepersberg W", "TITLE": "Identification of stsC, the gene encoding the L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase from streptomycin-producing Streptomycetes.", "JOURNAL": "Arch Microbiol 168:102-13 (1997)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:1377151", "AUTHORS": "Distler J, Mansouri K, Mayer G, Stockmann M, Piepersberg W", "TITLE": "Streptomycin biosynthesis and its regulation in Streptomycetes.", "JOURNAL": "Gene 115:105-11 (1992)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:1654502", "AUTHORS": "Mansouri K, Piepersberg W.", "TITLE": "Genetics of streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus: nucleotide sequence of five genes, strFGHIK, including a phosphatase gene.", "JOURNAL": "Mol Gen Genet 228:459-69 (1991)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:9922132", "AUTHORS": "Fritsche E, Bergner A, Humm A, Piepersberg W, Huber R", "TITLE": "Crystal structure of L-arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase StrB1 from Streptomyces griseus: an enzyme involved in streptomycin biosynthesis.", "JOURNAL": "Biochemistry 37:17664-72 (1998)"}], "REL_PATHWAY": "eco00523  Polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko00521"}
