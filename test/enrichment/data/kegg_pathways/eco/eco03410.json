{"ENTRY": "eco03410                    Pathway", "NAME": "Base excision repair", "DESCRIPTION": "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.", "CLASS": "Genetic Information Processing; Replication and repair", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco03410": "Base excision repair"}, "DBLINKS": {"GO": "0006284 0006285 0006286 0006287 0006288"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "GENE": {"b3635": "mutM; DNA-formamidopyrimidine glycosylase [KO:K10563] [EC:3.2.2.23 4.2.99.18]", "b0714": "nei; endonuclease VIII [KO:K05522] [EC:3.2.2.- 4.2.99.18]", "b1633": "nth; endonuclease III [KO:K10773] [EC:4.2.99.18]", "b2068": "alkA; DNA-3-methyladenine glycosylase 2 [KO:K01247] [EC:3.2.2.21]", "b3549": "tag; 3-methyl-adenine DNA glycosylase I, constitutive [KO:K01246] [EC:3.2.2.20]", "b3068": "mug; stationary phase mismatch/uracil DNA glycosylase [KO:K03649] [EC:3.2.2.28]", "b2580": "ung; uracil-DNA glycosylase [KO:K03648] [EC:3.2.2.27]", "b2961": "mutY; adenine DNA glycosylase [KO:K03575] [EC:3.2.2.31]", "b1749": "xthA; exodeoxyribonuclease III [KO:K01142] [EC:3.1.11.2]", "b2159": "nfo; endonuclease IV [KO:K01151] [EC:3.1.21.2]", "b3863": "polA; DNA polymerase I [KO:K02335] [EC:2.7.7.7]", "b2892": "recJ; ssDNA-specific exonuclease RecJ [KO:K07462] [EC:3.1.-.-]", "b2411": "ligA; DNA ligase [KO:K01972] [EC:6.5.1.2]", "b3647": "ligB; DNA ligase B [KO:K01972] [EC:6.5.1.2]"}, "REFERENCE": [{"REFERENCE": "PMID:17893748", "AUTHORS": "Krwawicz J, Arczewska KD, Speina E, Maciejewska A, Grzesiuk E.", "TITLE": "Bacterial DNA repair genes and their eukaryotic homologues: 1.
