{"ENTRY": "eco03420                    Pathway", "NAME": "Nucleotide excision repair", "DESCRIPTION": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.", "CLASS": "Genetic Information Processing; Replication and repair", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco03420": "Nucleotide excision repair"}, "DBLINKS": {"GO": "0006289"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "GENE": {"b1114": "mfd; transcription-repair coupling factor [KO:K03723] [EC:3.6.4.-]", "b4058": "uvrA; excision nuclease subunit A [KO:K03701]", "b0779": "uvrB; excision nuclease subunit B [KO:K03702]", "b1913": "uvrC; excision nuclease subunit C [KO:K03703]", "b3813": "uvrD; DNA helicase II [KO:K03657] [EC:5.6.2.4]", "b3863": "polA; DNA polymerase I [KO:K02335] [EC:2.7.7.7]", "b2411": "ligA; DNA ligase [KO:K01972] [EC:6.5.1.2]", "b3647": "ligB; DNA ligase B [KO:K01972] [EC:6.5.1.2]"}, "REFERENCE": [{"REFERENCE": "PMID:11436314", "AUTHORS": "Sugasawa K.", "TITLE": "[Molecular mechanism of mammalian nucleotide excision repair]", "JOURNAL": "Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso 46:893-901 (2001)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:11436316", "AUTHORS": "Nakatsu Y.", "TITLE": "[Transcription-coupled repair and Cockayne syndrome]", "JOURNAL": "Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso 46:908-15 (2001)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:11436323", "AUTHORS": "Nakagawa N, Masui R, Kuramitsu S.", "TITLE": "[Structure and function of DNA repair enzyme UvrB from Thermus thermophilus HB8]", "JOURNAL": "Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso 46:968-75 (2001)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:17276014", "AUTHORS": "Kraemer KH, Patronas NJ, Schiffmann R, Brooks BP, Tamura D, DiGiovanna JJ.", "TITLE": "Xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome: a complex genotype-phenotype relationship.", "JOURNAL": "Neuroscience 145:1388-96 (2007)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:17884153", "AUTHORS": "Saldivar JS, Wu X, Follen M, Gershenson D.", "TITLE": "Nucleotide excision repair pathway review I: implications in ovarian cancer and platinum sensitivity.", "JOURNAL": "Gynecol Oncol 107:S56-71 (2007)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:16922398", "AUTHORS": "Sugasawa K.", "TITLE": "[DNA repair pathways involving Cul4A ubiquitin ligases]", "JOURNAL": "Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso 51:1339-44 (2006)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:18018633", "AUTHORS": "Ito S, Ando D, Tanaka K.", "TITLE": "[Cross-talk between DNA repair and transcription: molecular mechanism and disorders]", "JOURNAL": "Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso 52:1823-31 (2007)"}], "REL_PATHWAY": "eco03020  RNA polymerase", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko03420"}
