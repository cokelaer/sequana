{"ENTRY": "eco00780                    Pathway", "NAME": "Biotin metabolism", "DESCRIPTION": "Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is the essential cofactor of biotin-dependent carboxylases, such as pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Mammals cannot synthesize biotin, while in bacteria, fungi, and plants it is synthesized from pimelate thioester through different pathways. In E. coli and many organisms, pimelate thioester is derived from malonyl-ACP. The pathway starts with the methylation to malonyl-ACP methyl ester, followed by the fatty acid chain elongation cycle to form pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester, which is then demethylated to form pimeloyl-ACP [MD:M00572]. Pimeloyl-ACP is converted to biotin through the final four steps in the biotin bicyclic ring assembly, which are conserved among biotin-producing organisms [MD:M00123]. In B. subtilis, biotin is derived from pimeloyl-ACP formed by oxidative cleavage of long-chain acyl-ACPs [MD:M00573]. Some bacteria synthesize biotin from pimeloyl-CoA derived from pimelate [MD:M00577]. Biotin is covalently attached to biotin-dependent carboxylase by biotin protein ligase, also known as holocarboxylase synthase in mammals, to form an active holocarboxylase. After degradation of the biotinylated carboxylase into biocytin, it is further degraded by biotinidase to release free biotin, which is recycled in holocarboxylase synthesis. Biotin is catabolized by beta-oxidation of the valeric acid side chain or oxidation of sulfur in the heterocyclic ring.", "CLASS": "Metabolism; Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco00780": "Biotin metabolism"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00123": "Biotin biosynthesis, pimeloyl-ACP/CoA => biotin [PATH:eco00780]", "eco_M00572": "Pimeloyl-ACP biosynthesis, BioC-BioH pathway, malonyl-ACP => pimeloyl-ACP [PATH:eco00780]"}, "DBLINKS": {"GO": "0006768"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "GENE": {"b0777": "bioC; malonyl-acyl carrier protein methyltransferase [KO:K02169] [EC:2.1.1.197]", "b2323": "fabB; 3-oxoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase 1 [KO:K00647] [EC:2.3.1.41]", "b1095": "fabF; 3-oxoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase 2 [KO:K09458] [EC:2.3.1.179]", "b1093": "fabG; 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase FabG [KO:K00059] [EC:1.1.1.100]", "b0180": "fabZ; 3-hydroxy-acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase [KO:K02372] [EC:4.2.1.59]", "b1288": "fabI; enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase [KO:K00208] [EC:1.3.1.9 1.3.1.10]", "b3412": "bioH; pimeloyl-acyl carrier protein methyl ester esterase [KO:K02170] [EC:3.1.1.85]", "b0776": "bioF; 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase [KO:K00652] [EC:2.3.1.47]", "b0774": "bioA; adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase [KO:K00833] [EC:2.6.1.62]", "b0778": "bioD; dethiobiotin synthetase [KO:K01935] [EC:6.3.3.3]", "b1593": "ynfK; putative dethiobiotin synthetase [KO:K01935] [EC:6.3.3.3]", "b0775": "bioB; biotin synthase [KO:K01012] [EC:2.8.1.6]", "b3973": "birA; DNA-binding transcriptional repressor/biotin-[acetyl-CoA-carboxylase] ligase BirA [KO:K03524] [EC:6.3.4.15]", "b3551": "bisC; biotin sulfoxide reductase [KO:K08351] [EC:1.-.-.-]"}, "COMPOUND": {"C00047": "L-Lysine", "C00086": "Urea", "C00120": "Biotin", "C01037": "7,8-Diaminononanoate", "C01063": "6-Carboxyhexanoyl-CoA", "C01092": "8-Amino-7-oxononanoate", "C01209": "Malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein]", "C01894": "Biotinyl-CoA", "C01909": "Dethiobiotin", "C02656": "Pimelate", "C05552": "Biocytin", "C05921": "Biotinyl-5'-AMP", "C06250": "Holo-[carboxylase]", "C19673": "Malonyl-[acp] methyl ester", "C19845": "Pimeloyl-[acyl-carrier protein]", "C19846": "Pimeloyl-[acyl-carrier protein] methyl ester", "C20372": "3-Ketoglutaryl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20373": "3-Hydroxyglutaryl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20374": "Enoylglutaryl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20375": "Glutaryl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20376": "3-Ketopimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20377": "3-Hydroxypimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20378": "Enoylpimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester", "C20384": "Bisnorbiotin", "C20385": "Tetranorbiotin", "C20386": "Biotin sulfoxide", "C20387": "Biotin sulfone", "C20683": "Long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier protein]", "C22458": "8-Amino-7-(carboxyamino)nonanoate"}, "REFERENCE": [{"REFERENCE": "PMID:21437340", "AUTHORS": "Lin S, Cronan JE", "TITLE": "Closing in on complete pathways of biotin biosynthesis.", "JOURNAL": "Mol Biosyst 7:1811-21 (2011)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:22965231", "AUTHORS": "Lin S, Cronan JE", "TITLE": "The BioC O-methyltransferase catalyzes methyl esterification of malonyl-acyl carrier protein, an essential step in biotin synthesis.", "JOURNAL": "J Biol Chem 287:37010-20 (2012)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:20693992", "AUTHORS": "Lin S, Hanson RE, Cronan JE", "TITLE": "Biotin synthesis begins by hijacking the fatty acid synthetic pathway.", "JOURNAL": "Nat Chem Biol 6:682-8 (2010)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:21435937", "AUTHORS": "Cronan JE, Lin S", "TITLE": "Synthesis of the alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acid precursor of biotin by the canonical fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.", "JOURNAL": "Curr Opin Chem Biol 15:407-13 (2011)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:11368323", "AUTHORS": "Stok JE, De Voss J", "TITLE": "Expression, purification, and characterization of BioI: a carbon-carbon bond cleaving cytochrome P450 involved in biotin biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis.", "JOURNAL": "Arch Biochem Biophys 384:351-60 (2000)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:18838690", "AUTHORS": "Cryle MJ, Schlichting I", "TITLE": "Structural insights from a P450 Carrier Protein complex reveal how specificity is achieved in the P450(BioI) ACP complex.", "JOURNAL": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105:15696-701 (2008)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:8763940", "AUTHORS": "Bower S, Perkins JB, Yocum RR, Howitt CL, Rahaim P, Pero J", "TITLE": "Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the Bacillus subtilis biotin biosynthetic operon.", "JOURNAL": "J Bacteriol 178:4122-30 (1996)"}, {"REFERENCE": "PMID:1445232", "AUTHORS": "Ploux O, Soularue P, Marquet A, Gloeckler R, Lemoine Y", "TITLE": "Investigation of the first step of biotin biosynthesis in Bacillus sphaericus.
