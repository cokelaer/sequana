{"ENTRY": "eco01220                    Pathway", "NAME": "Degradation of aromatic compounds", "DESCRIPTION": "Microorganisms are known to be capable of degrading diverse chemical substances including man-made chemicals in the environment that are mostly aromatic compounds. This diagram illustrates combination patterns of reaction modules for biodegradation of aromatic compounds, consisting of three main types of ring dihydroxylation modules, followed by meta- or ortho-cleavage modules, together with an optional preprocessing module for converting methyl group to carboxyl group on the aromatic ring.", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco01220": "Degradation of aromatic compounds"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00545": "Trans-cinnamate degradation, trans-cinnamate => acetyl-CoA [PATH:eco01220]"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko01220"}
