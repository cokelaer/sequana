{"ENTRY": "eco01200                    Pathway", "NAME": "Carbon metabolism", "DESCRIPTION": "Carbon metabolism is the most basic aspect of life. This map presents an overall view of central carbon metabolism, where the number of carbons is shown for each compound denoted by a circle, excluding a cofactor (CoA, CoM, THF, or THMPT) that is replaced by an asterisk. The map contains carbon utilization pathways of glycolysis (map00010), pentose phosphate pathway (map00030), and citrate cycle (map00020), and six known carbon fixation pathways (map00710 and map00720) as well as some pathways of methane metabolism (map00680). The six carbon fixation pathways are: (1) reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle) in plants and cyanobacteria that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, (2) reductive citrate cycle in photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria and some chemolithoautotrophs, (3) 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle in photosynthetic green nonsulfur bacteria, two variants of 4-hydroxybutyrate pathways in Crenarchaeota called (4) hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle and (5) dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and (6) reductive acetyl-CoA pathway in methanogenic bacteria.", "PATHWAY_MAP": {"eco01200": "Carbon metabolism"}, "MODULE": {"eco_M00001": "Glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof pathway), glucose => pyruvate [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00002": "Glycolysis, core module involving three-carbon compounds [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00004": "Pentose phosphate pathway (Pentose phosphate cycle) [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00005": "PRPP biosynthesis, ribose 5P => PRPP [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00006": "Pentose phosphate pathway, oxidative phase, glucose 6P => ribulose 5P [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00007": "Pentose phosphate pathway, non-oxidative phase, fructose 6P => ribose 5P [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00008": "Entner-Doudoroff pathway, glucose-6P => glyceraldehyde-3P + pyruvate [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00009": "Citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00010": "Citrate cycle, first carbon oxidation, oxaloacetate => 2-oxoglutarate [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00011": "Citrate cycle, second carbon oxidation, 2-oxoglutarate => oxaloacetate [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00012": "Glyoxylate cycle [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00020": "Serine biosynthesis, glycerate-3P => serine [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00021": "Cysteine biosynthesis, serine => cysteine [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00168": "CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism), dark [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00307": "Pyruvate oxidation, pyruvate => acetyl-CoA [PATH:eco01200]", "eco_M00579": "Phosphate acetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway, acetyl-CoA => acetate [PATH:eco01200]"}, "ORGANISM": "Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 [GN:eco]", "KO_PATHWAY": "ko01200"}
